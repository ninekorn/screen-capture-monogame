# screen-capture-monogame
screen capture using sharpdx in monogame. i used xoofx original ScreenCapture c# scripts in the SharpDX-Samples found here:
https://github.com/sharpdx/SharpDX-Samples/tree/master/Desktop/Direct3D11.1/ScreenCapture

i have built this program by myself using the normal standard monogame startup project.

currently it's quite lame, you have to create a folder named "monoScreen" on your desktop and monogame writes the desktop screen to a png/jpg inside of that folder. Now i just need to have it displayed on the screen. it's just a backup program kinda, that i will mix with my repo https://github.com/ninekorn/SCCoreSystemsMono soon. when i have the chance to script.

thank you for reading me.
